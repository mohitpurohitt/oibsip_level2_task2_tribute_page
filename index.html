            Swami Vivekananda ( 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born
            Narendranath Datta ,was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author,
            religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic
            Ramakrishna.[4][5] He was a key figure in the introduction of
            Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world[6] and is credited with
            raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of
            a major world religion. <br /><br />

            Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta,
            Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and
            spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a
            monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured
            the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand knowledge of the
            living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by
            their plight, he resolved to help his countrymen and found a way to
            travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after
            the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, in which he began his
            famous speech with the words: Sisters and brothers of America...
            before introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] He was so
            impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him
            as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at
            the Parliament". <br />
            <br />

            After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years,
            Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States,
            England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu
            philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the
            Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern
            California),[13] both of which became the foundations for Vedanta
            Societies in the West. In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna
            Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and
            householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission that provides
            charity, social work and education. <br /><br />

            <strong>Education</strong><br />
            In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar
            Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to
            school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877.[30] In 1879, after
            his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive
            first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination.
            [31] He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including
            philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and
            literature.[32] He was also interested in Hindu scriptures,
            including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the
            Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. Narendra was trained in
            Indian classical music,[33] and regularly participated in physical
            exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western
            logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General
            Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church
            College).[34] In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts examination, and
            completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884.[35][36] Narendra
            studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb
            Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer,
            Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin.[37][38] He
            became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and
            corresponded with him,[39][40] translating Herbert Spencer's book
            Education (1861) into Bengali.[41] While studying Western
            philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali
            literature.[38]

              On learning that Vivekananda lacked credentials to speak at the
              Chicago Parliament, Wright said "To ask for your credentials is
              like asking the sun to state its right to shine in the heavens.
